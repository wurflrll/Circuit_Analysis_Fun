# Inverter as Amplifier


The classic 2 FET digital inverter circuit looks quite a lot similar to push-pull amplifiers, and indeed they can be used in a similar way.

In an ideal inverter circuit, the PMOS and NMOS transistors are perfectly balanced, and we get a curve like this, where we see the steepest part (highest $\frac{\DeltaV_o}{\DeltaV_{in}}$) at $V_{in} = \frac{V_{dd}}{2}$.
