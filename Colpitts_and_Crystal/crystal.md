# Now The Crystal

## Intro
The most common crystal oscillator is probably the Pierce oscillator (with use in microcontrollers).  The issue with this is that I wanted something closer to a sinusoid to serve as the basis for my AM modulator.  The crystal I chose to implement in my circuit is a 27 MHz crystal oscillator found on LCSC.
